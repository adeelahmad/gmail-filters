Thanks
======

A huge thanks goes to [Andreas Fuchs](https://github.com/antifuchs) for
creating [gmail-britta](https://github.com/antifuchs/gmail-britta). I had long
sought a tool for assisting with the creation of Gmail filters, and
[gmail-britta](https://github.com/antifuchs/gmail-britta) suits my purpose well.
